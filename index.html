                The origin
            </h2>
            <p class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
                I was born in a little town in South Africa called Greytown. My parents and older sister had just moved from Greytown before I was born to the outskirts
                of a nearby city called Pietermaritzburg. My mom knew the doctors in Greytown so she went back there to give
                birth to me.
                I do not remember that much for the first few years of my life but then I guess not many people do. I know my dad spent a lot
                of time going back to Switzerland to work as that is where he is from. It made sense as the conversion rate was good so he
                would go back to make more money. Then when I was four he went and didn't come back. The next few years were rather difficult
                for our family but it taught me to work hard. When I was seven my mom got remarried and I got a little sister and about the same
                time I met one of my best friends Joshua.<br /><br />
                <h2 class="container col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
                    Teen years
                </h2>
            <p class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
                My early teen years were not that difficult for me. I spent a lot of time working on the farm and in my spare time I would go to
                Joshua's house and game. I never really played computer games at home besides paint and pinball but Joshua got me into proper
                computer games. It was at Joshua's house that I met Andrew, someone that is now a really good friend and father figure to me.
                Andrew got me into canoeing and running. I come to love the two sports, I was homeschooled so never partook in sport.

                After a few years, Andrew realised that I was four years behind in school and offered to help out if I was willing to put in the
                effort. I thought about it for a while and decided it was a good decision. We came to the conclusion that the best way to do it was
                if I went to his house during the week to do school. I would then not get distracted by the farm and could work on the farm during the weekend.
                I approached my mom and stepdad about it and they freaked out resulting in me leaving home at sixteen. I was now totally dependent
                on Andrew. He helped me a lot with school and I managed to catch up. When I was nineteen we moved to a town called Ipswich in England.
                I finished off my last bit of school and started waitering while I learnt programming on the side.

            <p class="container col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
                I have now decided to leave waitering and devote all my time to learning web development. I enjoy programming, running, calisthenics, drawing and playing chess.
